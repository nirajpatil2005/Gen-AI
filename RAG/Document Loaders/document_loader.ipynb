       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'cricket.txt'}, page_content=\"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket, a set of three wooden stumps sited at each end. One team, designated the batting team, attempts to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents field. Each phase of play is called an innings. After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a set number of overs have been completed, the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained, during their period batting. At the start of each game, two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play. The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team, known as the bowler, delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other, towards a set of wooden stumps, in front of which stands one of the batsmen, known as the striker. The striker's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat, and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler. The bowler's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman, at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease. The most common forms of dismissal are bowled, when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball, leg before wicket, when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat, and caught, when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground. Runs are scored through two main methods: either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary, or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball. If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground, a run-out occurs. Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires. The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs, to Test cricket, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard, solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core. Although cricket's origins are uncertain, it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century. ICC, the game's governing body, has over 100 members, ten of which are full members who play Test cricket. Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport, after association football, and is followed primarily in Australasia, Great Britain and Ireland, the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa and the West Indies.\")]"

       "'Cricket is a bat-and-ball contest between two teams of eleven, played on a grass field with a 22-yard pitch at its centre. One team bats while the other fields; after ten wickets fall or a set number of overs are bowled, the sides swap roles. The team amassing the most runs—including extras—wins. Play begins when the bowler delivers the ball toward the striker, who tries to hit it and score runs with his partner; dismissals such as bowled, lbw, caught and run-out end a batsman’s stay. Runs come from boundary hits or by the batsmen running between the wickets. Two on-field umpires enforce laws codified by the ICC and MCC. Formats range from the three-hour Twenty20 to five-day Test matches. Players traditionally wear white, but coloured kits are used in limited-overs games, often supplemented by protective gear against the hard leather ball. Originating in 16th-century England, cricket spread with the British Empire; today the ICC governs over 100 nations, with ten full members contesting Tests. Women’s cricket is also established internationally. The sport ranks as the world’s second most-watched, especially popular in Australasia, Britain, the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa and the Caribbean.'"

Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. \\nExpenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always \\nare. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy \\nhour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Some\\xad\\nthing fine and rare and sterling - something just a little bit near to \\nbeing worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim. \\nThere was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Per\\xad\\nhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very \\nagile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence \\nof longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his \\nlooks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art. \\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the \\nglass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its \\ncolour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair \\nand let it fall to its full length. \\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham \\nYoungs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold \\nwatch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other \\nwas Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the \\nairshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some \\nday to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had \\nKing Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the \\nbasement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he \\npassed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy. \\nSo now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shin\\xad\\ning like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and \\nmade itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again \\nnervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood \\nstill while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet. \\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. \\nWith a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her \\neyes, she fluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the \\nstreet. \\nWhere she stopped the sign read: 'Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods \\nof All Kinds.' One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, pant\\xad\\ning. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the 'Sofronie.' \\n'Will you buy my hair?' asked Della. \\n'I buy hair,' said Madame. 'Take yer hat off and let's have a \\nsight at the looks of it.' \\nDown rippled the brown cascade. \\n'Twenty dollars,' said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised \\nhand.\"),\n",

Forget \\nthe hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's \\npresent. \\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one \\nelse. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had \\nturned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple \\nand chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance \\nalone and not by meretricious ornamentation - as all good things \\nshould do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it \\nshe knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and \\nvalue - the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they \\ntook from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. \\nWith that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about \\nthe time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes \\nlooked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he \\nused in place of a chain. \\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to \\nprudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the \\ngas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity \\nadded to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends - a \\nmammoth task. \\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-\\nlying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. \\nShe looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and \\ncritically. \\n'If Jim doesn't kill me,' she said to herself, 'before he takes a \\nsecond look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. \\nBut what could I do - oh! what could I do with a dollar and \\neighty-seven cents?' \\nAt seven o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on \\nthe back of the stove, hot and ready to cook the chops. \\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and \\nsat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. \\nThen she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, \\nand she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying \\nlittle silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now \\nshe whispered: 'Please God, make him think I am still pretty.' \\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked \\nthin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two - and \\nto be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he \\nwas without gloves.\"),\n",

It \\nwas not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any \\nof the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared \\nat her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face. \\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him. \\n\\'Jim, darling,\\' she cried, \\'don\\'t look at me that way.

I\\'m me without my hair, ain\\'t I?\\' \\nJim looked about the room curiously. \\n\\'You say your hair is gone?\\' he said with an air almost of idiocy. \\n\\'You needn\\'t look for it,\\' said Della. \\'It\\'s sold, I tell you - sold \\nand gone, too.

By some chance the little \\ntable at which I sat had escaped the eye of incomers, and two \\nvacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the \\ninflux of patrons. \\nAnd then a cosmopolite sat in one of them, and I was glad, for \\nI held a theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has \\nexisted. We hear of them, and we see foreign labels on much \\nluggage, but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites. \\nI invoke your consideration of the scene - the marble-topped \\ntables, the range of leather-upholstered wall seats, the gay com\\xad\\npany, the ladies dressed in demi-state toilets, speaking in an \\nexquisite visible chorus of taste, economy, opulence or art, the \\nsedulous and largess-loving garçons, the music wisely catering to all \\nwith its raids upon the composers; the mélange of talk and laughter \\n- and, if you will, the Würzburger in the tall glass cones that bend \\nto your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a \\nrobber jay.

Rushmore Coglan, Esq., the Earth, \\nSolar System, the Universe,' and have mailed it, feeling confident \\nthat it would be delivered to him. \\nI was sure that I had at last found the one true cosmopolite since \\nAdam, and I listened to his world-wide discourse fearful lest I \\nshould discover in it the local note of the mere globe-trotter. But \\nhis opinions never fluttered or drooped; he was as impartial to \\ncities, countries and continents as the winds or gravitation. \\nAnd as E. Rushmore Coglan prattled of this little planet I \\nthought with glee of a great almost-cosmopolite who wrote for the \\nwhole world and dedicated himself to Bombay. In a poem he has \\nto say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the \\nearth, and that 'the men that breed from them, they traffic up and \\ndown, but cling to their cities' hem as a child to the mother's \\ngown.' And whenever they walk 'by roaring streets unknown' they \\nremember their native city 'most faithful, foolish, fond; making \\nher mere-breathed name their bond upon their bond.' And my \\nglee was roused because I had caught Mr. Kipling napping. Here I \\nhad found a man not made from dust; one who had no narrow \\nboasts of birthplace or country, one who, if he bragged at all, \\nwould brag of his whole round globe against the Martians and the \\ninhabitants of the Moon. \\nExpression on these subjects was precipitated from E. Rush-\\nmore Coglan by the third corner to our table. While Coglan was \\ndescribing to me the topography along the Siberian Railway the \\norchestra glided into a medley. The concluding air was 'Dixie,' \\nand as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost over\\xad\\npowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table. \\nIt is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be \\nwitnessed every evening in numerous cafés in the City of New \\nYork. Tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account \\nfor it. Some have conjectured hastily that all Southerners in town \\nhie themselves to cafés at nightfall. This applause of the 'rebel' air \\nin a Northern city does puzzle a little; but it is not insolvable. The \\nwar with Spain, many years' generous mint and water-melon \\ncrops, a few long-shot winners at the New Orleans race-track, and \\nthe brilliant banquets given by the Indiana and Kansas citizens \\nwho compose the North Carolina Society, have made the South \\nrather a 'fad' in Manhattan.

In order to attend one of these dances you must be a \\nmember of the Give and Take - or, if you belong to the division \\nthat starts off with the right foot in waltzing, you must work in \\nRhinegold\\'s paper-box factory. Still, any Clover Leaf was privi\\xad\\nleged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance. But \\nmostly each Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he \\naffected; and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at \\nthe regular hops. \\nMaggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and \\nleft-handed style of footwork in the two-step, went to the dances \\nwith Anna McCarty and her \\'fellow.\\' Anna and Maggie worked \\nside by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever. So \\nAnna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie\\'s house every \\nSaturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them. \\nThe Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The \\nhall of the association in Orchard Street was fitted out with muscle-\\nmaking inventions. With the fibres thus builded up the members \\nwere wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organiza\\xad\\ntions in joyous combat. Between these more serious occupations the \\nSaturday night hops with the paper-box factory girls came as a refin\\xad\\ning influence and as an efficient screen. For sometimes the tip went \\n\\'round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back \\nstairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter-weight \\naffair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes. \\nOn Saturdays Rhinegold\\'s paper-box factory closed at 3 p.m. \\nOn one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward \\ntogether. At Maggie\\'s door Anna said, as usual: \\'Be ready at seven, \\nsharp, Mag; and Jimmy and me\\'ll come by for you.\\''),\n",

Almost was she pretty now, with \\nthe unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her \\nfirst suitor and a kitten with its first mouse. \\n'Maggie Toole's got a fellow at last,' was the word that went \\nround among the paper-box girls. 'Pipe Mag's floor-walker' - thus \\nthe Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt. \\nUsually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm \\nwith her back. She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a \\nself-sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was \\ncheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing \\nAnna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for \\nhim to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step. \\nBut to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry \\nO'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole \\nwinged her first butterfly flight. And though our tropes of fairy\\xad\\nland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one \\ndrop of ambrosia from the rose-crowned melody of Maggie's one \\nperfect night. \\nThe girls besieged her for introductions to her 'fellow.' The \\nClover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly \\nperceived charms in Miss Toole. They flexed their compelling \\nmuscles before her and bespoke her for the dance. \\nThus she scored; but to Terry O'Sullivan the honours of the \\nevening fell thick and fast. He shook his curls; he smiled and went \\neasily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own \\nroom before an open window ten minutes each day. He danced like \\na faun; he introduced manner and style and atmosphere; his words \\ncame trippingly upon his tongue, and - he waltzed twice in succes\\xad\\nsion with the paper-box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought. \\nDempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, \\nand could chin the bar twice with one hand. He was one of 'Big \\nMike' O'Sullivan's lieutenants, and was never troubled by trouble. \\nNo cop dared to arrest him.

He made a quick movement, but Andy \\nGeoghan was ready and caught his arm. \\nDempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of \\nthe club, and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. \\nTwo other members of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined \\nthe little group. Terry O'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board \\nof Rules and Social Referees.

Back of the association hall was a \\nsmaller room rented by the club. In this room personal difficulties \\nthat arose on the ballroom floor were settled, man to man, with \\nthe weapons of nature, under the supervision of the Board. No \\nlady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a Clover Leaf hop \\nin several years.

And without slacking the \\nspeed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream - leaped in \\ntime to catch and hang upon the arm of O'Sullivan that was sud\\xad\\ndenly uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto that \\nhe had drawn from his bosom. \\nThe knife fell and rang upon the floor.

When \\nwild goose honk high of nights, and when women without sealskin \\ncoats grow kind to their husbands, and when Soapy moves \\nuneasily on his bench in the park, you may know that winter is \\nnear at hand. \\nA dead leaf fell in Soapy's lap. That was Jack Frost's card. Jack is \\nkind to the regular denizens of Madison Square, and gives fair \\nwarning of his annual call. At the corners of four streets he hands \\nhis pasteboard to the North Wind, footman of the mansion of All \\nOutdoors, so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready. \\nSoapy's mind became cognizant of the fact that the time had \\ncome for him to resolve himself into a singular Committee of Ways \\nand Means to provide against the coming rigour. And therefore he \\nmoved uneasily on his bench. \\nThe hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. \\nIn them were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of \\nsoporific Southern skies or drifting in the Vesuvian Bay. Three \\nmonths on the Island was what his soul craved. Three months of \\nassured board and bed and congenial company, safe from Boreas \\nand bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable. \\nFor years the hospitable Blackwell's had been his winter quar\\xad\\nters. Just as his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought \\ntheir tickets to Palm Beach and the Riviera each winter, so Soapy \\nhad made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the \\nIsland. And now the time was come. On the previous night three \\nSabbath newspapers, distributed beneath his coat, about his ankles \\nand over his lap, had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his \\nbench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square. So the \\nIsland loomed large and timely in Soapy's mind. He scorned the \\nprovisions made in the name of charity for the city's dependents.\"),\n",

But to one of Soapy's proud \\nspirit the gifts of charity are encumbered. If not in coin you must \\npay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands \\nof philanthropy. As Caesar had his Brutus, every bed of charity \\nmust have its toll of a bath, every loaf of bread its compensation of \\na private and personal inquisition. Wherefore it is better to be a \\nguest of the law, which, though conducted by rules, does not \\nmeddle unduly with a gentleman's private affairs. \\nSoapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about \\naccomplishing his desire. There were many easy ways of doing \\nthis. The pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive \\nrestaurant; and then, after declaring insolvency, be handed over \\nquietly and without uproar to a policeman. An accommodating \\nmagistrate would do the rest. \\nSoapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across \\nthe level sea of asphalt, where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow \\ntogether, Up Broadway he turned, and halted at a glittering café, \\nwhere are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the \\ngrape, the silkworm and the protoplasm. \\nSoapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest \\nupward. He was shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, \\nready-tied four-in-hand had been presented to him by a lady mis\\xad\\nsionary on Thanksgiving Day. If he could reach a table in the restau\\xad\\nrant unsuspected success would be his. The portion of him that \\nwould show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter's \\nmind. A roasted mallard duck, thought Soapy, would be about the \\nthing - with a bottle of Chablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse \\nand a cigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total \\nwould not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of \\nrevenge from the café management; and yet the meat would leave \\nhim filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge. \\nBut as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head \\nwaiter's eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes. \\nStrong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in \\nsilence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of \\nthe menaced mallard. \\nSoapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that his route to the cov\\xad\\neted Island was not to be an epicurean one. Some other way of \\nentering limbo must be thought of.\"),\n",

Soapy \\nstood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of \\nbrass buttons. \\n'Where's the man that done that?' inquired the officer excitedly. \\n'Don't you figure out that I might have had something to do \\nwith it?' said Soapy, not without sarcasm, but friendly, as one \\ngreets good fortune. \\nThe policeman's mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue. \\nMen who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law's \\nminions. They take to their heels. The policeman saw a man half\\xad\\nway down the block running to catch a car. With drawn club he \\njoined in the pursuit. Soapy, with disgust in his heart, loafed \\nalong, twice unsuccessful. \\nOn the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great \\npretensions. It catered to large appetites and modest purses. Its \\ncrockery and atmosphere were thick; its soup and napery thin. \\nInto this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and tell-tale trousers \\nwithout challenge. At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flap\\xad\\njacks, doughnuts and pie. And then to the waiter he betrayed the \\nfact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers. \\n'Now, get busy and call a cop,' said Soapy. 'And don't keep a \\ngentleman waiting.' \\n'No cop for youse,' said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes \\nand an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. 'Hey, Con!' \\nNeatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters \\npitched Soapy. He arose, joint by joint, as a carpenter's rule opens, \\nand beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed but a rosy \\ndream. The Island seemed very far away. A policeman who stood \\nbefore a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the \\nstreet. \\nFive blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to \\nwoo capture again. This time the opportunity presented what he \\nfatuously termed to himself a 'cinch.' A young woman of a modest \\nand pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with \\nsprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and \\ntwo yards from the window a large policeman of severe \\ndemeanour leaned against a water-plug. \\nIt was Soapy's design to assume the role of the despicable and \\nexecrated 'masher.'

He made eyes at her, \\nwas taken with sudden coughs and 'hems,' smiled, smirked and \\nwent brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of \\nthe 'masher.' With half an eye Soapy saw that the policeman was \\nwatching him fixedly. The young woman moved away a few steps, \\nand again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving \\nmugs. Soapy followed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his hat \\nand said: \\n'Ah there, Bedelia! Don't you want to come and play in my \\nyard?' \\nThe policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman \\nhad but to beckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route \\nfor his insular haven. Already he imagined he could feel the cosy \\nwarmth of the station-house. The young woman faced him and, \\nstretching out a hand, caught Soapy's coat-sleeve. \\n'Sure, Mike,' she said joyfully, 'if you'll blow me to a pail of \\nsuds. I'd have spoke to you sooner, but the cop was watching.' \\nWith the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak \\nSoapy walked past the policeman, overcome with gloom. He \\nseemed doomed to liberty. \\nAt the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He \\nhalted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets, \\nhearts, vows and librettos.

His silk umbrella he had set by the door on enter\\xad\\ning. Soapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella and sauntered off \\nwith it slowly. The man at the cigar light followed hastily. \\n'My umbrella,' he said sternly. \\n'Oh, is it?' sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. 'Well, \\nwhy don't you call a policeman? I took it. Your umbrella! Why \\ndon't you call a cop? There stands one at the corner.' \\nThe umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a \\npresentiment that luck would again run against him.

It macerates its opium and percolates its own laudanum and \\nparegoric. To this day pills are made behind its tall prescription \\ndesk - pills rolled out on its own pill-tile, divided with a spatula, \\nrolled with the finger and thumb, dusted with calcined magnesia \\nand delivered in little round, pasteboard pill-boxes. The store is on \\na corner about which coveys of ragged-plumed, hilarious children \\nplay and become candidates for the cough-drops and soothing \\nsyrups that wait for them inside. \\nIkey Schoenstein was the night clerk of the Blue Light and the \\nfriend of his customers.

But Ikey was timid, and his \\nhopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness \\nand fears. Behind his counter he was a superior being, calmly \\nconscious of special knowledge and worth; outside, he was a \\nweak-kneed, purblind, motorman-cursed rambler, with ill-fitting \\nclothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and \\nvalerianate of ammonia. \\nThe fly in Ikey's ointment (thrice welcome, pat trope!) was \\nChunk McGowan. \\nMr. McGowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles \\ntossed about by Rosy. But he was no out-fielder as Ikey was; he \\npicked them off the bat. At the same time he was Ikey's friend and \\ncustomer, and often dropped in at the Blue Light Drug Store to \\nhave a bruise painted with iodine or get a cut rubber-plastered \\nafter a pleasant evening spent along the Bowery. \\nOne afternoon McGowan drifted in in his silent, easy way, and\"),\n",

'Not any Dagoes. \\nBut you've located the diagnosis all right enough - it's under my \\ncoat, near the ribs. Say!

He gave it a wild rap with the pestle, but felt \\nit not.

We've been layin' pipes for the gateway for two weeks. \\nOne day she says she will; the same evenin' she says nixy. We've \\nagreed on to-night, and Rosy's stuck to the affirmative this time \\nfor two whole days. But it's five hours yet till the time, and I'm \\nafraid she'll stand me up when it comes to the scratch.' \\n'You said you wanted drugs,' remarked Ikey. \\nMr. McGowan looked ill at ease and harassed - a condition \\nopposed to his usual line of demeanour. He made a patent-medi\\xad\\ncine almanac into a roll and fitted it with unprofitable carefulness \\nabout his finger. \\n'I wouldn't have this double handicap make a false start to-night \\nfor a million,' he said.

If \\nthe stuff'll work just for a couple of hours it'll do the trick.' \\n'When is this foolishness of running away to be happening?' \\nasked Ikey. \\n'Nine o'clock,' said Mr. McGowan. 'Supper's at seven. At eight \\nRosy goes to bed with a headache. At nine old Parvenzano lets me \\nthrough to his backyard, where there's a board off Riddle's fence, \\nnext door.

Scattered upon \\nthe flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins - those discreet, \\nindistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infi\\xad\\nnite of mood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, \\nconscious of their triumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the \\ndrawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded, tiny, ragged \\nhandkerchief. He pressed it to his face. It was racy and insolent \\nwith heliotrope; he hurled it to the floor. In another drawer he \\nfound odd buttons, a theatre programme, a pawnbroker's card, \\ntwo lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of dreams. In the \\nlast was a woman's black satin hair-bow, which halted him, poised \\nbetween ice and fire. But the black satin hair-bow also is feminin\\xad\\nity's demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales. \\nAnd then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, \\nskimming the walls, considering the corners of the bulging mat\\xad\\nting on his hands and knees, rummaging mantel and tables, the \\ncurtains and hangings, the drunken cabinet in the corner, for a vis\\xad\\nible sign unable to perceive that she was there beside, around, \\nagainst, within, above him, clinging to him, wooing him, calling \\nhim so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser \\nones became cognizant of the call.

'Why, \\nthat you had not brought Mrs. Bellford to New York with you, of \\ncourse. I do wish you had. I would have liked to see Marian.' Her \\nvoice lowered slightly - 'You haven't changed much, Elwyn.' \\nI felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more \\nclosely. \\n'Yes, you have,' she amended, and there was a soft, exultant note \\nin her latest tones; 'I see it now.

And when I had paid for \\nthat I took leave of him brusquely; for I wanted no more of him. \\nBut before I had obtained my release he had prated loudly of an \\nincome that his wife received, and showed a handful of silver \\nmoney. \\nWhen I got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously: \\n'If that man Caswell has annoyed you, and if you would like to \\nmake a complaint, we will have him ejected. He is a nuisance, a \\nloafer, and without any known means of support, although he \\nseems to have some money most the time.

But I would like to place myself on \\nrecord as asserting that I do not care for his company. Your town,' \\nI continued, 'seems to be a quiet one. What manner of entertain\\xad\\nment, adventure, or excitement have you to offer to the stranger \\nwithin your gates?' \\n'Well, sir,' said the clerk, 'there will be a show here next Thurs\\xad\\nday. It is - I'll look it up and have the announcement sent up to \\nyour room with the ice water. Good night.' \\nAfter I went up to my room I looked out of the window. It was \\nonly about ten o'clock, but I looked upon a silent town. The driz\\xad\\nzle continued, spangled with dim lights, as far apart as currants in \\na cake sold at the Ladies' Exchange. \\n'A quiet place,' I said to myself, as my first shoe struck the ceil\\xad\\ning of the occupant of the room beneath mine. 'Nothing of the \\nlife here that gives colour and variety to the cities in the East and \\nWest. Just a good, ordinary, humdrum business town.' \\nNashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centres of the \\ncountry. It is the fifth boot and shoe market in the United States, the largest \\ncandy and cracker manufacturing city in the South, and does an enormous \\nwholesale dry goods, grocery and drug business.\"),\n",

I \\nwas travelling elsewhere on my own business, but I had a com\\xad\\nmission from a Northern literary magazine to stop over there and \\nestablish a personal connection between the publication and one \\nof its contributors, Azalea Adair. \\nAdair (there was no clue to the personality except the handwrit\\xad\\ning) had sent in some essays (lost art!) and poems that had made \\nthe editors swear approvingly over their one o'clock luncheon. So \\nthey had commissioned me to round up said Adair and corner by \\ncontract his or her output at two cents a word before some other \\npublisher offered her ten or twenty. \\nAt nine o'clock the next morning, after my chicken livers en bro\\xad\\nchette (try them if you can find that hotel), I strayed out into the \\ndrizzle, which was still on for an unlimited run. At the first corner \\nI came upon Uncle Cæsar. He was a stalwart negro, older than the \\npyramids, with grey wool and a face that reminded me of Brutus, \\nand a second afterwards of the late King Cetewayo. He wore the \\nmost remarkable coat that I ever had seen or expect to see. It \\nreached to his ankles and had once been a Confederate grey in \\ncolours. But rain and sun and age had so variegated it that Joseph's \\ncoat, beside it, would have faded to a pale monochrome. I must \\nlinger with that coat for it has to do with the story - the story that \\nis so long in coming, because you can hardly expect anything to \\nhappen in Nashville. \\nOnce it must have been the military coat of an officer. The cape \\nof it had vanished, but all adown its front it had been frogged and \\ntasselled magnificently. But now the frogs and tassels were gone. \\nIn their stead had been patiently stitched (I surmised by some sur\\xad\\nviving 'black mammy') new frogs made of cunningly twisted \\ncommon hempen twine. This twine was frayed and dishevelled. It \\nmust have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished \\nsplendours, with tasteless but painstaking devotion, for it followed \\nfaithfully the curves of the long-missing frogs. And, to complete \\nthe comedy and pathos of the garment, all its buttons were gone \\nsave one. The second button from the top alone remained. The \\ncoat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the button\\xad\\nholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side. There \\nwas never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so \\nmany mottled hues. The lone button was the size of a half-dollar, \\nmade of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine. \\nThis negro stood by a carriage so old that Ham himself might\"),\n",

She was a product of the old South, gently nur\\xad\\ntured in the sheltered life. Her learning was not broad, but was \\ndeep and of splendid originality in its somewhat narrow scope. She \\nhad been educated at home, and her knowledge of the world was \\nderived from inference and by inspiration. Of such is the precious, \\nsmall group of essayists made.

She was exquis\\xad\\nite, she was a valuable discovery.

A \\nhouse and a dress she had, not much else, I fancied. So, divided \\nbetween my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and \\nessayists who fought Thomas in the valley of the Cumberland, I \\nlistened to her voice, which was like a harpsichord's, and found \\nthat I could not speak of contracts.

But I spoke of my mission, and \\nthree o'clock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of \\nthe business proposition. \\n'Your town,' I said, as I began to make ready to depart (which is \\nthe time for smooth generalities), 'seems to be a quiet, sedate \\nplace.

At one time they might have called each other old friends. \\nDawe had some money in those days, and lived in a decent apart\\xad\\nment-house near Westbrook's. The two families often went to \\ntheatres and dinners together. Mrs. Dawe and Mrs. Westbrook \\nbecame 'dearest' friends. Then one day a little tentacle of the \\noctopus, just to amuse itself, ingurgitated Dawe's capital, and he \\nmoved to the Gramercy Park neighbourhood, where one, for a \\nfew groats per week, may sit upon one's trunk under eight-\\nbranched chandeliers and opposite Carrara marble mantels and \\nwatch the mice play upon the floor. Dawe thought to live by writ\\xad\\ning fiction. Now and then he sold a story. He submitted many to \\nWestbrook. The Minerva printed one or two of them; the rest \\nwere returned. Westbrook sent a careful and conscientious per\\xad\\nsonal letter with each rejected manuscript, pointing out in detail \\nhis reasons for considering it unavailable. Editor Westbrook had \\nhis own clear conception of what constituted good fiction. So had \\nDawe. Mrs. Dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents \\nof the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together. \\nOne day Dawe had been spouting to her about the excellences \\nof certain French writers. At dinner they sat down to a dish that \\na hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp. Dawe \\ncommented. \\n'It's Maupassant hash,' said Mrs. Dawe. 'It may not be art, but I \\ndo wish you would do a five course Marion Crawford serial with \\nan Ella Wheeler Wilcox sonnet for dessert. I'm hungry.' \\nAs far as this from success was Shackleford Dawe when he \\nplucked Editor Westbrook's sleeve in Madison Square. That was \\nthe first time the editor had seen Dawe in several months. \\n'Why, Shack, is this you?' said Westbrook somewhat awk\\xad\\nwardly, for the form of this phrase seemed to touch upon the \\nother's changed appearance. \\n'Sit down for a minute,' said Dawe, tugging at his sleeve.

      "watching him fixedly. The young woman moved away a few steps, \n",
      "and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving \n",
      "mugs. Soapy followed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his hat \n",
      "and said: \n",
      "'Ah there, Bedelia! Don't you want to come and play in my \n",
      "yard?' \n",
      "The policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman \n",
      "had but to beckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route \n",
      "for his insular haven. Already he imagined he could feel the cosy \n",
      "warmth of the station-house. The young woman faced him and, \n",
      "stretching out a hand, caught Soapy's coat-sleeve. \n",
      "'Sure, Mike,' she said joyfully, 'if you'll blow me to a pail of \n",

      "Soapy walked past the policeman, overcome with gloom. He \n",
      "seemed doomed to liberty. \n",
      "At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He \n",
      "halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets, \n",
      "hearts, vows and librettos. Women in furs and men in greatcoats \n",
      "moved gaily in the wintry air. A sudden fear seized Soapy that some \n",
      "dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest. The \n",
      "thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon \n",
      "another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent \n",
      "theatre he caught at the immediate straw of 'disorderly conduct.' \n",
      "On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the \n",
      "top of his harsh voice. He danced, howled, raved and otherwise \n",
      "disturbed the welkin. \n",
      "The policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and \n",
      "remarked to a citizen: \n",
      "' 'Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin' the goose egg they give \n",
      "to the Hartford College. Noisy; but no harm. We've instructions \n",
      "to lave them be.'\n"
